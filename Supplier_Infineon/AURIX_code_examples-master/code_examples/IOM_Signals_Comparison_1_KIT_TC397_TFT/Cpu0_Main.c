 /*\title Comparison of signals via IOM
 * \abstract Two PWM signals are compared by the IOM module.
 * \description Two PWM signals are routed through the port pins to the Input Output Module (IOM) as monitor and
 *              reference respectively. The signals are continuously compared using exclusive OR. If the newly formed
 *              signal (XOR) is in high state outside the acceptable propagation window, an LED is switched on.
