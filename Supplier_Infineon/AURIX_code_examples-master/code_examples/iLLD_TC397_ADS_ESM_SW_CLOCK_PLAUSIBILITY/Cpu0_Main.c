 /*\title Clock Plausibility
 * \abstract This code example presents the implementation of software based Clock Plausibility.
 * \description The scope of this project is to understand how to implement a software based clock plausibility
 *              ESM (External Safety Mechanism). Application Software (SW) shall evaluate the different clock frequencies
 *              provided by Peripheral PLL Configuration 1 register (PERPLLCON1.K2, PERPLLCON1.K3) with a time measurement
 *              based on System PLL Configuration 1 register (SYSPLLCON1.K2) clock frequency, where K2 and K3 are divider
 *              values. If the measured and expected clock frequency values does not match, the application SW shall
 *              trigger an alarm.
