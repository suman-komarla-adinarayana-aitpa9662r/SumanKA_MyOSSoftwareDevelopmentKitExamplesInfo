 /*\title Register Access Protection
 * \abstract This example shows how to protect registers from unintended write access by using AURIX register access protection mechanisms.
 * \description The CPU0 tries to make a write access to an ASCLIN0 module register two times: when the access is
 *              enabled for CPU0 and when the access is disabled for CPU0. During the second register write access,
 *              a Trap is expected to be raised, to inform about the illegal write access.
